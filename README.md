Disclaimer:
This project was initiated in the spring of 2022 as part of a computer science class. The primary objective was to grasp the fundamentals of programming and to experience working in smaller sub-groups. Ultimately, most of the project work landed on my shoulders, and we had the opportunity to play the game during the last week of school.

The multiplayer racing game comprises both a server and client program. Anyone wishing to play on their devices will need the `racing_client.py` file along with the necessary fonts. For the server, the required files are `racing_server.py`, `bewegung.py`, the fonts, and the associated graphics. The server program renders the game track and displays it on the screen, while the client programs merely show the current user input.

Admittedly, the game's "fun factor" isn't particularly high. This is partly due to minor bugs, such as getting stuck when hitting the track edges at certain angles. Nonetheless, it was an incredibly enriching project, offering invaluable insights into the essentials of programming and the importance of communication within a team.
